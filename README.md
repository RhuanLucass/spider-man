# Spider-Man Project

This project was created in honor of the iconic Spider-Man through the FrontPush course. Integrates GSAP for animations, introduces a background image carousel and incorporates a lightweight SCSS library. The main focus is on replicating the Figma design and enhancing it with GSAP animations.
